# Installation

For now, FakeCI needs to be compiled from source. You will need `cargo` and a rust toolchain.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paulollivier/fake-ci
cargo install --path fake-ci
```

This will take some time, you may prepare some coffee.

That's it! You now have the `fake-ci` executable
